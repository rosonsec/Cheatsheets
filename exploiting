# Buffer Overflow

1. Determine length of overflow trigger w/ binary search "A"x1000
2. Determine exact EIP with pattern_create.rb & pattern_offset.rb
3. Determine badchars to make sure all of your payload is getting through
4. Develop exploit
  Is the payload right at ESP --> JMP ESP
  Is the payload before ESP: 
    sub ESP, 200 and then JMP ESP
    or
    call [ESP-200]
5. Create payload with msfvenom making sure it fits the payload length above.
6. Exploit!
