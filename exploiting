# Buffer Overflow

1. Determine length of overflow trigger with binary search "A"x1000
https://github.com/rosonsec/Exploits/blob/master/fuzzer.py 
Ex: Application crashes sending 1800 bytes

2. Determine exact EIP with pattern_create.rb and pattern_offset.rb
msf-pattern_create -l 1800
Use it as buffer to crash the app again
Get the EIP (xxxxxx)
msf-pattern_offset.rb -l 1800 -q xxxxxx
Result is the offset yyyy
buffer= 'A' * yyyy + 'B' * 4 + 'C' 

3. Determine badchars to make sure the payload will be valid.

4. Develop the exploit
  Is the payload right at ESP --> JMP ESP
  Is the payload before ESP: 
    sub ESP, 200 and then JMP ESP
    or
    call [ESP-200]

5. Create payload with msfvenom making sure it fits the payload length above.

6. Exploit!
